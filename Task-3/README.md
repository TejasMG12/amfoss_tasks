## :dart: About ##

For this task I have used Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm <br>
for finding prime numbers upto a number.
<br>
The way this algorithm works is, <br>
it starts from 2, as 2 is prime it marks all the multiples of 2 upto n as false,<br>
and then does the same for next number if its not marked as false.<br>
Finally all the numbers not marked as false are Primes.
